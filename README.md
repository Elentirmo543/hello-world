# hello-world
Building a remote short-message display box using the Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller and Ethernet2 shield boards, and a LCD controller/display board based on the HD44780 chip. The Ethernet2 shield was made by a different supplier than the maker of the IDE I'm using, so getting the right library files to run it will be a challenge.
